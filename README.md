# gino-tornado

An extension for GINO to support Tornado server.

## Contents

- examples
  - (navigation system)[examples/navigation-system/index.md]: simple tdd crud app for drone route management, contains a simple tornado-gino application and its tornado.testing testcases.
- tutorials
  - basic tornado-gino (soon)
  - production tips (soon)

## Current status

Since GINO 1.0, the built-in extensions are now separate projects supported by
the community. This project is copied here directly from GINO 0.8.x for
compatibility. Help is needed to:

* Keep this project maintained - follow Tornado releases, fix issues, etc.
* Add more examples and documentation.
* Answer questions in the community.
